                                  MAY 18, 1999
 
                                                                  April 14, 1999
 
     This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of
Proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of UST Corp. (the
"Company") to be held on May 18, 1999, and at any adjournments thereof, for the
purposes set forth in the foregoing Notice of Annual Meeting.
 
     The close of business on March 26, 1999 has been fixed as the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
Annual Meeting, and at any adjournments thereof.
 
     The financial statements for the Company for the fiscal year ended December
31, 1998, together with corresponding financial information for the previous
fiscal year, are contained in the Annual Report to UST Corp. Stockholders for
the year ended December 31, 1998 (the "Annual Report"), which includes the
Company's Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998 (the "10-K Report"). A copy of
each of the Company's Annual Report and 10-K Report has been previously mailed
or will be mailed simultaneously herewith to all stockholders.
 
     Proxies in the form enclosed are solicited by the Board of Directors of the
Company. Any stockholder giving a Proxy in the enclosed form has the power to
revoke it at any time before it is exercised. A stockholder's right to revoke
his or her Proxy is not limited by, or subject to, compliance with any specified
formal procedure. Each stockholder may revoke his or her Proxy by attending the
meeting and voting in person. Proxies in such form, if received in time for
voting and not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with
the directions of the stockholders. Where a choice is not so specified, the
shares represented by a properly executed Proxy will be voted "for" the election
of the seven (7) nominees for Director positions listed therein and "for" the
approval of the Amendment to the Company's By-Laws. The enclosed Proxy confers
discretionary authority on Neal F. Finnegan, Eric R. Fischer and James K. Hunt
(or their substitutes), acting singly, to act on any other business which may
properly come before the meeting. The Board of Directors does not know of any
matters which will be brought before the meeting other than those specifically
set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting. Should another matter, however,
properly come before the meeting, it is intended that the persons named in the
enclosed form of Proxy, or their substitutes acting thereunder, will vote on
such matter or matters in accordance with their best judgment.
 
     The Company will bear all expenses in connection with the solicitation of
Proxies, including the preparation, assembly and mailing of the Proxy Statement.
Solicitation will be initially by mail, but employees and Directors of the
Company, as well as representatives of Morrow & Co., professional proxy
solicitors, may solicit Proxies by personal interview, by telephone, by
facsimile or by telecopy. Employees and Directors of the Company will not
receive additional compensation for such efforts, and Morrow & Co. is expected
to receive approximately $5,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses, for such
solicitation. The Company will also provide persons, firms, banks and
corporations holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees,
which in either case are beneficially owned by others, with proxy material for
transmittal to such beneficial owners and reimburse such record holders for
their reasonable expenses in so doing. Confidential voting procedures will not
be used in connection with the Annual Meeting, except that votes cast by
employees of the Company and/or its subsidiaries shall be held confidential.

     As of March 8, 1999, the Company had outstanding 42,664,732 shares of
common stock, $0.625 par value per share ("Common Stock"), each entitled to one
vote. A majority, or 21,332,367 of such shares, constitutes a quorum for the
Annual Meeting. There are no outstanding shares of Preferred Stock of the
Company.
 
                     PERSONS TO BE NOMINATED BY MANAGEMENT
                           FOR ELECTION AS DIRECTORS
                                (NOTICE ITEM 1)
 
     Section 50A of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts General Laws provides for
a Board of Directors of such number as is fixed by the Directors, divided into
three classes as nearly equal in number as possible, serving staggered
three-year terms. The Board of Directors has fixed the number of Directors at
twenty-four (24). The Board of Directors has the power to fill vacancies and to
change the size of the Board at any time. The Board of Directors, following the
recommendation of its Nominating Committee, has recommended the seven (7)
nominees listed in the chart below (all of whom are currently Directors) to fill
the seven (7) positions, each of whom, if elected, will hold office for a
three-year term until the 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until his or
her successor is chosen and qualified. In addition, this recommendation
contemplates that one position on the Board of Directors expiring in 1999 will
remain vacant and may be filled later by the Board of Directors. Unless
otherwise specified, Proxies will be voted in favor of the seven (7) nominees'
election as Directors. Pursuant to the By-Laws of the Company, Directors will be
elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Thus, shares for
which authority to vote for one or more nominees is withheld will have no effect
on the election of those one or more individuals.
 
     On March 17, 1998, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the
Nominating Committee, established a mandatory retirement age of seventy (70)
years for members of the Board of Directors. This mandatory retirement age
policy for the Board of Directors does not affect senior officers of the Company
or USTrust, its lead banking subsidiary, who serve on the Board of Directors of
the Company. Each Director who is currently 70 or more years of age will remain
a Director until his or her term of office expires, at which time he or she will
not be eligible to be nominated for re-election. Pursuant to the new policy,
Directors who are currently less than 70 years old and who are re-elected to the
Board will retire on the date of their 70th birthday if they attain age 70
during the course of their term. In accordance with the foregoing policy, three
Directors, Messrs. Jack E. Chappell, Edward J. Sullivan and Gordon M. Weiner are
retiring from the Board of the Company on May 18, 1999, the date of the Annual
Meeting and Sydney L. Miller will retire from the Board on the date of his 70th
birthday, December 8, 1999. Although Mr. Weiner will retire as a Director of the
Company on May 18, 1999, the Company expects to renominate Mr. Weiner as a
Director of the Company's subsidiary, United States Trust Company, to serve a
one year term. Shareholders of the Company are not voting on Mr. Weiner's
election as a Director of United States Trust Company.

DIRECTORS' FEES AND OTHER COMPENSATION
 
     Directors of the Company who are not otherwise full-time Officers or
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are paid an annual stipend
which in 1998 was $15,000. Furthermore, a Director receives up to a maximum of
$6,000 annually in meeting fees. Meeting fees are reduced by the percentage of
meetings which the Director was eligible to attend, but did not attend. For
example, should a Director of the Company who is also a USTrust Director and is
eligible to attend 20 Board meetings (12 plus 8) miss 5 meetings of the 20, the
Director would receive $4,500 rather than the full $6,000 of meeting fees. On
the other hand, if the Director were a Director of the Company only, and
attended 8 of those 8 scheduled meetings the Director would receive a full
$6,000 in meeting fees. Furthermore, in 1998, Directors (other than full-time
employees of the Company) received the following additional committee fees:

     Instead of receiving a retainer or meeting fees, Mr. Schwartz received a
stipend of $60,000 in 1998 for his services as Chairman of the Board of
Directors. In 1998, Mr. Ridge received a stipend of $55,000 for services
performed in his capacity as Vice Chairman of USTrust, also in lieu of a
retainer or meeting fees.
 
     At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 1995, the 1995 Directors' Stock
Option Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders. Pursuant to that Plan,
outside Directors of the Company and USTrust received options to acquire shares
at the market price ($12.875) on the date of the meeting, May 16, 1995. Options
were granted as follows: individuals who were Directors of both the Company and
USTrust received 7,500 options; individuals who were solely Directors of the
Company received 5,100 options; individuals who were solely honorary Directors
of the Company received 4,500 options; and individuals who were solely Directors
of USTrust received 3,000 options. These options vested during 1997. In addition
to the foregoing, in May 1996, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the
Company's stockholders approved the 1996 Directors' Stock Option Plan which
granted outside Directors of the Company 5,000 immediately exercisable options
at $13.438, the market price on May 21, 1996, the date of the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.
 
     The Company also maintains a deferred compensation program which covers
Directors of the Company and Directors of any subsidiary of the Company whose
Board of Directors elects to participate. Under this program, Directors may
elect to defer all or any portion of their Directors' meeting fees and annual
stipend. Each participant is treated as a general, unsecured creditor of the
Company and has the right to receipt of his other deferred compensation upon
termination of Director status. Payments of the deferred amounts are made in
shares of Common Stock of the Company.

                       COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
 
     The tables that appear below, together with the accompanying text and
footnotes, provide information on compensation and benefits for the named
Executive Officers, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "Named Executive Officers"). Except for the
information regarding individual stock option exercises, all the data regarding
values for stock options and grants of Restricted Common Stock are hypothetical
in terms of the amounts that an individual may or may not receive because such
amounts are contingent on continued employment by the individual with the
Company and are based on the price of the Common Stock as of the particular
reference date. All 1998 year-end values shown in these tables for outstanding
Common Stock options and restricted Common Stock ("Restricted Common Stock")
shares reflect a $23.5625 price, which was the closing price of the Common Stock
on December 31, 1998, as reported in the Nasdaq section of the Eastern Edition
of The Wall Street Journal.
 
     The following table displays compensation information for the past three
fiscal years for each of the Named Executive Officers:

     As of December 31, 1997, the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan was
     merged into the Company's Employee Savings Plan and accordingly, no
     allocations under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan were made for 1998.
     Amounts allocated to Mr. Hansberry for 1998 under the Lexington Savings
     Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan have not, as of the date hereof, been
     determined by the Company's actuarial consultants.
 
(C) The Company entered into a restated and amended Employment Agreement with
    Mr. Finnegan, effective January 1, 1999 and ending December 31, 2001, under
    which Mr. Finnegan receives a base salary of $600,000, subject to
    discretionary increases. In addition, on January 4, 1999, Mr. Finnegan was
    granted a total of 360,000 fully vested stock options, with a per share
    exercise price of $23.6875, the fair market value on January 4, 1999, and
    10,000 shares of Restricted Common Stock which vest over a two year period.
    See "Employment Agreements." Mr. Finnegan's base salary was $520,000 in
    1998, $480,000 in 1997 and $360,000 in 1996.
 
(D) Mr. Hansberry became Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of the
    Company and President and Chief Operating Officer of USTrust in August,
    1998, following the acquisition by the Company of Affiliated Community
    Bancorp, Inc., the bank holding company for which Mr. Hansberry had served
    as a Director and President and Chief Executive Officer. Cash compensation
    paid to Mr. Hansberry for services rendered to Affiliated Community Bancorp,
    Inc. in 1998 is included in the above table. Of the amounts reported for
    1998, $204,171 of Mr. Hansberry's salary was paid by Affiliated Community
    Bancorp, Inc. and the balance of each item was paid by the Company. Mr.
    Hansberry entered into an Employment Agreement with the Company, effective
    August 10, 1998 for an initial term ending on January 4, 2000, automatically
    renewing for a first renewal term expiring on August 9, 2001, and thereafter
    continuing to run year-to-year unless terminated in writing by either party
    upon 60-days notice. See "Employment Agreements."

                            STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
     The Stock Compensation Plan originally adopted in 1992, as amended to date,
provides for granting of Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options and
Restricted Common Stock Awards or a combination of the foregoing as a means
through which the Company seeks to attract and retain highly qualified employees
and attract and encourage able persons to enter into and remain in the Company's
and its subsidiaries' employ. The Plan is designed to encourage key employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries to acquire and maintain stock ownership,
thereby strengthening their commitment to the welfare of the Company and
promoting the identity of interests between stockholders and key employees.
 
     The following table provides details regarding stock options granted to the
Named Executive Officers in 1998 under the Stock Compensation Plan. In addition,
in accordance with SEC rules, this table shows hypothetical gains on a pre-tax
basis or "option spreads" that would exist for the respective options granted in
1998 for the Named Executive Officers. These gains are based on assumed rates of
annual compound stock price appreciation of 0%, 5% and 10% from the date the
options were granted over the full option term.

     To the extent that benefits cannot be provided under the Pension Plan or
certain other retirement plans of the Company because of the limitations imposed
by Sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code on the amount of
such benefits payable, any balance of benefits otherwise payable under such
plans will be provided by the Company to eligible officers pursuant to a
Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan adopted by the Board of Directors. As of
December 31, 1998, all individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table were
covered by the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan. In addition, all
individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table were covered by the Senior
Executive Plan which is a supplemental retirement plan that provides a maximum
benefit equal to 50% of five year average compensation. For purposes of this
plan, compensation includes salary, certain cash payments and certain Restricted
Stock bonus payments.
 
                         COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
 
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
 
     This Report reflects the Company's compensation philosophy and resulting
actions taken by the Company for 1998, as shown in the various compensation
tables above. The Compensation Committee either approves or recommends to the
Board of Directors salary and bonus amounts and stock award levels for Executive
Officers of the Company and its affiliates. Directors who were also Executive
Officers did not participate in votes concerning their own remuneration or plans
under which they were eligible to receive any benefits.
 
     Compensation of Executive Officers of the Company has been designed
generally to: (i) compensate Executive Officers based upon corporate, business
unit and individual performance; (ii) motivate Executive Officers to achieve
strategic business initiatives and reward them for their achievement; (iii)
provide salary arrangements which are comparable (and in the aggregate at
approximately the 60th percentile when compared to those of the Company's peer
group competitors) as described below under "Salary"; and (iv) align the
interests of executives with the long-term interests of stockholders through
award opportunities that can result in the ownership of Common Stock. The
Committee does not at present, however, have any specific target level of Common
Stock ownership.
 
     In 1998, executive compensation was composed of base salary, discretionary
annual incentive awards, long-term incentive opportunities in the form of stock
options and Restricted Common Stock, and benefits typically offered to
executives by the Company's peer group competitors. Generally, as an executive's
level of responsibility increases, a greater portion of potential total
compensation tends to be based upon performance incentives and less on salary
and employee benefits, often causing greater variability in the individual's
absolute compensation level from year to year. Generally, the higher one rises
in the organization, the greater the mix of compensation shifts to reliance on
the Common Stock through stock-based awards. Specific
 
                                       12
<PAGE>   15
 
compensation and award levels are determined by the Compensation Committee,
using its discretion and considering both objective and subjective criteria.
 
     In 1996, the Compensation Committee adopted a written "UST Corp. Executive
Compensation Philosophy" (the "Compensation Philosophy"). The Compensation
Philosophy utilizes comparable peer company data analyses conducted by Executive
Alliance, the Company's independent employee compensation consultants, and calls
for procedures under which: (i) base salary shall be set so that the targeted
positioning is the 60th percentile for each position, based on asset size or
such other scope criteria; (ii) actual base salary for an individual relative to
the target pay shall be determined based on the individual's unique background,
experiences, personal skills and abilities as well as the business challenges
facing the Company which require the use of such attributes or skills; and (iii)
annual incentive targets shall be set at levels which approximate the 60th
percentile of total compensation, so as to drive and reward consistent
improvement in performance. The same peer company data analyses used to
establish salary ranges are to be used to calibrate incentive earning potential.
Performance goals may be set at levels which approximate the 75th percentile of
total compensation; and the annualized value of long-term incentive targets
shall be set at levels which approximate the 60th percentile of the competitive
total compensation, so as to drive and reward consistent improvement in
performance and shareholder value. Peer company data will be used to calibrate
long-term incentive earning potential. Performance goals may be set at levels
which approximate the 75th percentile of competitive total direct compensation
values.
 
     The Compensation Committee has granted substantial stock compensation to
Mr. Finnegan and the other Named Executive Officers in order to align more
closely the economic interests of these officers with those of the Company's
stockholders.
 
GENERAL BACKGROUND
 
     The Five-Year Stockholder Return comparison, which is found at the end of
the discussion of Compensation of Executive Officers, reflects the five-year
performance (including reinvestment of dividends) of the Company's Common Stock
as compared to the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods ("KBW") New England Bank Index and
the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.
 
     The following is a discussion of the Compensation Committee's bases for Mr.
Finnegan's compensation reported for 1998, and its general policies with respect
to the other Named Executive Officers in the Summary Compensation Table. Mr.
Finnegan served as Chief Executive Officer throughout 1998.
 
SALARY
 
     The Compensation Committee increased Mr. Finnegan's base salary from
$480,000 to $520,000 effective January 1, 1998. Based upon comparative analyses
of approximately 15 similarly-sized regional and national bank holding companies
provided to the Compensation Committee and advice provided by Executive Alliance
his base salary was increased to $600,000 effective January 1, 1999 to be
competitive with the base salaries of Chief Executive Officers of the banks and
bank holding companies analyzed. The increase is referenced in a restated and
amended three-year Employment Agreement with the Company effective January 1,
1999. (See "Employment Agreements".)
 
1998 CASH BONUS AWARDS
 
     Mr. Finnegan received a $520,000 cash bonus in early 1999 to reflect his
performance during 1998 (which is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table),
based upon a determination of the Compensation Committee, considering the
financial performance of the Company as measured according to the Annual
Incentive Plan adopted by the Company in 1998. Under the matching contribution
feature of UST Corp.'s Employee Savings Plan, Mr. Finnegan also received an
aggregate contribution of $6,400 for 1998.
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   16
 
1998 STOCK AWARDS
 
     The Company's Stock Compensation Plan, approved by stockholders in 1992,
permits the granting of several different types of stock-based awards. The
Company's 1989 Restricted Common Stock Bonus Award Program permits the granting
of awards of Restricted Common Stock. On January 2, 1997 Mr. Finnegan was
granted a total of 50,000 stock options, priced at $20.3125, the fair market
value at the close of trading on January 2, 1997. The options vested in 1997. As
part of an amendment and to reflect a one year extension of his employment
agreement in 1997, Mr. Finnegan also received a 10,800 share Restricted Common
Stock bonus in early 1997 which provides him with Restricted Common Stock for
the additional year of his contract on a basis consistent with the prior years
of his contract period. No options or Restricted Common Stock were granted to
Mr. Finnegan in 1998. On January 4, 1999, Mr. Finnegan was granted 360,000 fully
vested options to acquire the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price of
$23.6875 per share and 10,000 shares of Restricted Common Stock, which vests
over a two year period. (See "Employment Agreements".)
 
LIMITATION ON DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
     The Internal Revenue Code was amended in 1993 to disallow deductions on
annual compensation in excess of $1,000,000 for certain executives of public
companies, beginning in 1994. The Compensation Committee accordingly amended the
Stock Compensation Plan, imposing a per-employee limit on annual grants, which
was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 1994 Annual Meeting. The
Compensation Committee has monitored the impact of this law over the past
several years and has taken into consideration both the benefits of favorable
tax treatment for the Company and the necessity for the Compensation Committee
to have the discretion to take appropriate steps to further its executive
compensation philosophy and honor existing contractual obligations. As a result
of the foregoing, the Compensation Committee recommended to, and the Board of
Directors approved the Company's new Annual Incentive Plan which addresses the
foregoing tax considerations. The stockholders approved the new Annual Incentive
Plan at the Annual Meeting held on May 19, 1998.
 
     This Report was submitted by the Compensation Committee which is comprised
of the following Directors, none of whom is a full-time employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries:
          Donald C. Dolben, Chairman
        Paul D. Slater, Vice Chairman
        Robert L. Culver
        Francis X. Messina
        Gordon M. Weiner
 
          COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
 
     During 1998, the following persons served for a portion or all of the year
on the Compensation Committee: Robert L. Culver, Donald C. Dolben, Francis X.
Messina, Paul D. Slater and Gordon M. Weiner.
 
     Officers and Directors of the Company, and their associates, are customers
of the Company and its subsidiaries and, as such, may have obtained loans and
loan commitments in excess of $60,000. All such loans and loan commitments
outstanding since the beginning of the last fiscal year were made in the
ordinary course of business by the Company's banking subsidiaries and on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and did
not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other
unfavorable terms.
 
     The members of the Compensation Committee, and their respective associates,
may have had an interest in certain transactions involving the Company or its
subsidiaries during 1998. In addition to loan transactions and other customer
transactions, during the past fiscal year the Company and its subsidiaries have
used products or services of, and have had other transactions with, various
organizations with which Officers and Directors of the Company are affiliated.
The amounts involved have in no case been material in relation to the business
of the Company and its subsidiaries and it is believed that they have not been
material in relation to the business of such other organizations or to the
individuals concerned. It is expected that in the future the Company and its
subsidiaries will continue to have transactions similar to those described in
this paragraph.

                    FIVE-YEAR STOCKHOLDER RETURN COMPARISON
 
     The following table compares the total return on the Company's Common Stock
over the last five years to the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods ("KBW") New England Bank
Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index ("S&P 500"). The KBW New England Bank
Index is comprised of approximately 18 commercial and savings banks located
within the New England states and ranging in asset size from approximately $520
million to $10 billion. The Company has decided to include comparisons to this
index, which only first became available in 1994, because it provides a closer
comparison to the Company as it is entirely an index of mid-sized New England
banks and bank holding companies with similar geographical, size and market
characteristics. Most banks that use the KBW New England Bank Index also compare
themselves to the S&P 500. Total return values for these indices were calculated
based on cumulative total return values, assuming reinvestment of dividends.

Hansberry for good reason (exclusive of a change-in-control), he will receive

                     CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND INDEBTEDNESS
 
     As described above under "Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation," the Company and its subsidiaries had certain lending and other
transactions and relationships with Directors, Officers and 5% stockholders of
the Company, and their associates, during 1998.
 
                RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
     The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, has
selected the firm of Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, as
auditors of the Company for 1999. The Company has been advised by such firm that
neither it nor any member or associate of such firm has any relationship with
the Company or with any of its affiliates other than as independent accountants
and auditors. Arthur Andersen LLP has served as the Company's independent
auditors since the Company's organization in 1967.
 
     Representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP will be present at the Annual
Meeting, will have an opportunity to make any statement they may desire to make,
and will be available to answer appropriate questions from stockholders.
 
               TO APPROVE, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD,
                     AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S BY-LAWS
                                (NOTICE ITEM 2)
 
     In January, 1999 the Board of Directors of the Company voted unanimously to
recommend to the Company's stockholders that Article I, Section 1 of the
Company's By-Laws be amended to change the date of the Company's Annual Meeting
of Stockholders from the third Tuesday in May to the third Tuesday in April;
commencing in the Year 2000. Should this Proposal be approved at this Meeting,
the Annual Meeting of the Company's stockholders in the Year 2000 would be held
on April 18, 2000.
 
     Although the Board of Directors characterizes the proposed Amendment to the
By-laws as a procedural matter, the Board considers the Amendment to the
Company's By-Laws as necessary and desirable for the following reasons:
 
          (i) The Board believes that the earlier Annual Meeting date will
     improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Board in addressing
     customary and other year-end Company business, such as the election of
     officers and addressing matters involving the Company's subsidiaries, by
     closely coordinating the timing of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders with
     the Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors. Based on the current meeting
     schedule, the Board now holds eight rather than twelve regular meetings
                                       18
<PAGE>   21
 
     during each year and is not scheduled to meet during the month of May.
     Therefore, (if the Company continued to hold the Annual Meeting of
     Stockholders in May) the Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors (always
     held after the Annual Meeting of Stockholders) would not be held until
     June, a full month after the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. By adopting
     the new date, however, Annual Meetings of the Stockholders and Directors
     may in fact be held on the same day.
 
          (ii) The change in the Annual Meeting would also better coordinate the
     Company's presentation to its stockholders with the completion and
     publication of the Company's year-end financial statements and Securities
     and Exchange Commission filings.
 
     Should the Proposal be adopted by the Company's Stockholders, Article I,
Section I of the By-Laws of the Company would be amended to read in its entirety
as follows:
 
          "1. ANNUAL MEETING.  The annual meeting of stockholders shall be
     held on the third Tuesday in April in each year (or if that be a legal
     holiday in the place where the meeting is to be held, on the next
     succeeding full business day) at 11:00 o'clock A.M. unless a different
     hour is fixed by the Directors or the President and stated in the
     notice of the meeting. The purposes for which the annual meeting is to
     be held, in addition to those prescribed by law, by the Articles of
     Organization or by these By-Laws, may be specified by the Directors or
     the President. If no annual meeting is held in accordance with the
     foregoing provisions, a special meeting may be held in lieu thereof,
     and any action taken at such meeting shall have the same effect as if
     taken at the annual meeting."
 
RECOMMENDATION OF YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL
 
     The Board of Directors believes that the adoption of the proposed Amendment
to the Company's By-Laws will promote the interests of the Company and its
stockholders. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted in favor
of the Proposal unless stockholders specify otherwise.
 
     To approve the Amendment to change the date of the Annual Meeting from the
third Tuesday in May to the third Tuesday in April, the vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares present or represented and entitled to vote on the
Proposal at the Annual Meeting is required. An abstention will have the effect
of a vote against the Proposal, while a broker non-vote (i.e., shares held by
brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the
beneficial owners and (ii) the broker or nominee does not have the discretionary
authority to vote on a particular matter) will have no effect on the outcome.
 
                      ACTION TO BE TAKEN -- OTHER BUSINESS
                                (NOTICE ITEM 3)
 
     As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors does not
intend to present at the Annual Meeting any business other than the two specific
items listed in the notice, and it has not been informed of any business
intended to be presented by others. Should any other matters, however, properly
come before the meeting, the persons named in the enclosed Proxy will take
action, and vote Proxies, in accordance with their judgment on such matters.
 
     Action may be taken on the business to be transacted at the meeting on the
date specified in the Notice of Annual Meeting or on any date or dates to which
such meeting may be adjourned.

                        SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT
 
     Other than Franklin Mutual Advisers, Inc., which reported beneficial
ownership as of December 31, 1998 of 6.1% of the Company's Common Stock, as of
March 1, 1999, the Company was unaware of any stockholder or related group of
stockholders which beneficially owned more than five percent of the Company's
Common Stock.
 
     The following table shows the number of shares and percentage of the
Company's Common Stock beneficially owned or owned through the Company's
Deferred Compensation Plan by each Director and nominee for Director, each Named
Executive Officer in the Summary Compensation Table above and by all Directors
and Officers of the Company as a group, as of March 1, 1999. Units in the
Deferred Compensation Plan have no voting rights and the underlying shares of
the Company's Common Stock associated with such units may not be sold until the
individual holder retires from the Company or dies.
